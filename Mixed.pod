=head1 NAME

Getopt::Mixed - extended getopt processing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Getopt::Mixed;
    Getopt::Mixed::getOptions(...option-descriptions...);
    ...examine $opt_* variables...

or

    use Getopt::Mixed "nextOption";
    Getopt::Mixed::init(...option-descriptions...);
    while (($option, $value) = nextOption()) {
        ...process option...
    }
    Getopt::Mixed::cleanup();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is my response to the standard modules Getopt::Std and
Getopt::Long.  C<Std> doesn't support long options, and C<Long>
doesn't support short options.  I wanted both, since long options are
easier to remember and short options are faster to type.

This package is intended to be the "Getopt-to-end-all-Getop's".  It
combines (I hope) flexibility and simplicity.  It supports both short
options (introduced by C<->) and long options (introduced by C<-->).
Short options which do not take an argument can be grouped together.
Short options which do take an argument must be the last option in
their group, because everything following the option will be
considered to be its argument.

There are two methods for using Getopt::Mixed:  the simple method and
the flexible method.  Both methods use the same format for option
descriptions.

=head2 Option Descriptions

The option-description arguments required by C<init> and C<getOptions>
are strings composed of individual option descriptions.  Several
option descriptions can appear in the same string if they are
separated by whitespace.

Each description consists of the option name and an optional trailing
argument specifier.  Option names may consist of any characters but
whitespace, C<=>, and C<:>.

Values for argument specifiers are:

  <none>   option does not take an argument
  =s :s    option takes a mandatory (=) or optional (:) string argument
  =i :i    option takes a mandatory (=) or optional (:) integer argument
  =f :f    option takes a mandatory (=) or optional (:) real number argument
  >new     option is a synonym for option `new'

The C<E<gt>> specifier is not really an argument specifier.  It
defines an option as being a synonym for another option.  For example,
"a=i apples>a" would define B<-a> as an option that requires an
integer argument and B<--apples> as a synonym for B<-a>.  Only one
level of synonyms is supported, and the root option must be listed
first.  For example, "apples>a a=i" and "a=i apples>a oranges>apples"
are illegal; use "a=i apples>a oranges>a" if that's what you want.

=head2 User Interface

From the user's perspective, short options are introduced by a dash
(C<->) and long options are introduced by a double dash (C<-->).
Short options may be combined ("-a -b" can be written "-ab"), but an
option that takes an argument must be the last one in its group,
because anything following it is considered part of the argument.  A
double dash by itself marks the end of the options; all arguments
following it are treated as normal arguments, not options.  A single
dash by itself is treated as a normal argument, I<not> an option.

In the following examples, B<-i> and B<--int> take integer arguments,
B<-f> and B<--float> take floating point arguments, and B<-s> and
B<--string> take string arguments.  All other options do not take an
argument.

  -i24            -f24.5               -sHello
  -i=24 --int=-27 -f=24.5 --float=0.27 -s=Hello --string=Hello

If the argument is required, it can also be separated by whitespace:

  -i 24 --int -27 -f 24.5 --float 0.27 -s Hello --string Hello

Note that if the option is followed by C<=>, whatever follows the C<=>
I<is> the argument, even if it's the null string.  In the example

  -i= 24 -f= 24.5 -s= Hello

B<-i> and B<-f> will cause an error, because the null string is not a
number, but B<-s> is perfectly legal; its argument is the null string,
not "Hello".

Remember that optional arguments I<cannot> be separated from the
option by whitespace.

=head2 The Simple Method

The simple method is

    use Getopt::Mixed;
    Getopt::Mixed::getOptions(...option-descriptions...);

You then examine the C<$opt_*> variables to find out what options were
specified and the C<@ARGV> array to see what arguments are left.

If B<-a> is an option that doesn't take an argument, then C<$opt_a>
will be set to 1 if the option is present, or left undefined if the
option is not present.

If B<-b> is an option that takes an argument, then C<$opt_b> will be
set to the value of the argument if the option is present, or left
undefined if the option is not present.  If the argument is optional
but not supplied, C<$opt_b> will be set to the null string.

Note that even if you specify that an option I<requires> a string
argument, you can still get the null string (if the user specifically
enters it).  If the option requires a numeric argument, you will never
get the null string (because it isn't a number).

When converting the option name to a Perl identifier, any non-word
characters in the name will be converted to underscores (C<_>).

If the same option occurs more than once, only the last occurrence
will be recorded.  If that's not acceptable, you'll have to use the
flexible method instead.

=head2 The Flexible Method

The flexible method is

    use Getopt::Mixed "nextOption";
    Getopt::Mixed::init(...option-descriptions...);
    while (($option, $value) = nextOption()) {
        ...process option...
    }
    Getopt::Mixed::cleanup();

This lets you process arguments one at a time.  You can then handle
repeated options any way you want to.  It also lets you see option
names with non-alphanumeric characters without any translation.  This
is also the only method that lets you find out what order the options
and other arguments were in.

First, you call Getopt::Mixed::init with the option descriptions.
Then, you keep calling nextOption until it returns an empty list.
Finally, you call Getopt::Mixed::cleanup when you're done.  The
remaining (non-option) arguments will be found in @ARGV.

Each call to nextOption returns a list of the next option and its
value.  The value will be undefined if the option does not take an
argument.  The option is stripped of its starter (e.g., you get "a"
and "foo", not "-a" or "--foo").

=head1 CUSTOMIZATION

There are several customization variables you can set.  All of these
variables should be set I<after> calling Getopt::Mixed::init and
I<before> calling nextOption.

If you are using the simple method, and you want to set these
variables, you'll need to call init before calling getOptions, like
this:

    use Getopt::Mixed;
    Getopt::Mixed::init(...option-descriptions...);
    ...set configuration variables...
    Getopt::Mixed::getOptions();      # IMPORTANT: no parameters

=over 4

=item $order

$order can be set to $REQUIRE_ORDER, $PERMUTE, or $RETURN_IN_ORDER.
The default is $REQUIRE_ORDER if the environment variable
POSIXLY_CORRECT has been set, $PERMUTE otherwise.

$REQUIRE_ORDER means that no options can follow the first argument
which isn't an option.

$PERMUTE means that all options are treated as if they preceded all
other arguments.

$RETURN_IN_ORDER means that all arguments maintain their ordering.
When nextOption is called, and the next argument is not an option, it
returns the null string as the option and the argument as the value.
nextOption never returns the null list until all the arguments have
been processed.

=item $ignoreCase

Ignore case when matching options.  Default is 1 unless the option
descriptions contain an upper-case letter.

=item $optionStart

A string of characters that can start options.  Default is "-".

=item $badOption

A reference to a function that is called when an unrecognized option
is encountered.  The function receives two arguments.  $_[0] is the
position in @ARGV where the option came from.  $_[1] is the option as
the user typed it (including the option start character). The option
has already been removed from @ARGV.  To put it back, you can say:

    splice(@ARGV,$_[0],0,$_[1]);

The function can do anything you want to @ARGV.  It should return
whatever you want nextOption to return.

The default is a function that prints an error message and exits the
program.

=item $checkArg

A reference to a function that is called to make sure the argument
type is correct.  The function receives four arguments.  $_[0] is the
position in @ARGV where the option came from.  $_[1] is the text
following the option, or undefined if there was no text following the
option.  $_[2] is the name of the option as the user typed it
(including the option start character), suitable for error messages.
$_[3] is the argument type specifier.

The function can do anything you want to @ARGV.  It should return
the value for this option.

The default is a function that prints an error message and exits the
program if the argument is not the right type for the option.  You can
also adjust the behavior of the default function by changing
$intRegexp or $floatRegexp.

=item $intRegexp

A regular expression that matches an integer.  Default is
'^[-+]?\d+$', which matches a string of digits preceded by an
optional sign.  Unlike the other configuration variables, this cannot
be changed after nextOption is called, because the pattern is compiled
only once.

=item $floatRegexp

A regular expression that matches a floating point number.  Default is
'^[-+]?(\d*\.?\d+|\d+\.)$', which matches the following formats:
"123", "123.", "123.45", and ".123" (plus an optional sign).  It does
not match exponential notation.  Unlike the other configuration
variables, this cannot be changed after nextOption is called, because
the pattern is compiled only once.

=item $typeChars

A string of the characters which are legal argument types.  The
default is 'sif', for String, Integer, and Floating point arguments.
The string should consist only of letters.  Upper case letters are
discouraged, since this will hamper the case-folding of options.  If
you change this, you should set $checkType to a function that will
check arguments of your new type.  Unlike the other configuration
variables, this must be set I<before> calling init(), and cannot be
changed afterwards.

=item $checkType

If you add new types to $typeChars, you should set this to a function
which will check arguments of the new types.

=head1 BUGS

=over 4

=item *

This document should be expanded.

=item *

A long option must be at least two characters long.  Sorry.

=item *

Long options cannot be abbreviated (by the user), although you (the
author) can provide a shorter synonym (or synonyms).

=item *

The C<!> argument specifier of Getopt::Long is not supported, but you
could have options B<--foo> and B<--nofoo> and then do something like:

    $opt_foo = 0 if $opt_nofoo;

=item *

The C<@> argument specifier of Getopt::Long is not supported.  If you
want your values pushed into an array, you'll have to use nextOption
and do it yourself.
