Getopt::Mixed $%v%$
Copyright 1995 Christopher J. Madsen

This module provides GNU-style option processing for Perl 5 scripts,
with both long and short options.  Please see the documentation at the
end of the module for instructions on its use and licensing
restrictions.

However, some time ago Getopt::Long was changed to support short
options as well, and it has the huge advantage of being part of the
standard Perl distribution.  So, Getopt::Mixed is now effectively
obsolete.  I don't intend to make any more changes, but I'm leaving it
available for people who have code that already uses it.  For new
modules, I recommend using Getopt::Long like this:

    use Getopt::Long;
    Getopt::Long::Configure(qw(bundling no_getopt_compat));
    GetOptions(...option-descriptions...);

You can use Makefile.PL to install Getopt::Mixed, but all you really
need to do is copy lib/Getopt/Mixed.pm to your Perl library.

tstopt1 and tstopt2 are sample scripts using Getopt::Mixed.  They
accept the following options and associated arguments:
  -a, --apples=N     Mandatory real number argument
      --apricots=N   Mandatory real number argument
  -b[N]              Optional integer argument
  -c                 No arguments
  -d[STRING]         Optional string argument
  -f, --file=STRING  Mandatory string argument
      --pears=N      Mandatory real number argument
  -?, --help         No arguments
  -V, --version      No arguments

Since these are just sample scripts, the options don't actually mean
anything.  tstopt1 demonstrates the simple method of using
Getopt::Mixed, and tstopt2 demonstrates the flexible method.
